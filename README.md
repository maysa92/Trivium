# Trivium
Implementation of the Trivium streaming cryptography schema.

Trivium is a synchronous stream cipher designed to provide a flexible trade-off between speed and gate count in hardware, and reasonably efficient software implementation. In this implementation, a user would be asked to input the plaintext, then be able to view the ciphertext and the decrypted plaintext.
